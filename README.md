# Mood classifier with ConvNets
Using ConvNets to create a mood classifier and identify sign language digits. This is not close to state-of-the arts, Just a basic two layer convNet. This is a very simple and basic ConvNet, the essense is to show the need for deeper ConvNet, transfer learning and fine tuning 
First, there is the Implementation of convolutional neural network (CONV) functions with numpy, implementing functions for padding,  pooling (POOL) layers, forward propagation etc. 
This project also involves building and traing a ConvNet in tensorflow for binary classification to classify mood by looking at the face, the classes are happy mode(laughing or smiling ) and not happy (not laughing). the mood classifier was built using the Tensorflow Keras Sequential API
The second part of the project is a multiclass classification project, a ConvNet was built and trained in TensorFlow for a multiclass classification of sign language digits using the TensorFlow Keras Functional API

# Requirements
* Python 3
* Tensorflow 2.7.0
